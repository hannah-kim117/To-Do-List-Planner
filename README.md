# To-Do-List-Planner

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Assignment 8 ~ Portfolio Frontend (Full Stack MERN)

This project represents an online planner website that allows users to make a customized to-do list by creating, editing, and deleting tasks.

In this Portfolio assignment, you'll modify your existing static website, so it runs in the React framework. This will involve reconfiguring the folder and file structure, as well as moving content into new page and component files. In addition, you will develop the frontend user interface for interacting with your backend MongoDB collection to perform CRUD operations.

This Assignment will require use of your existing website files: index.html, main.css, background image, and favicons. In addition, the backend MongoDB app will be combined to perform CRUD.
